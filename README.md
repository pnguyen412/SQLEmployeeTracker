# SQLEmployeeTracker

## Description
- The main objective of this challenge was to build an employee management CLI application using the inquirer and mysql packages.
- In addition to the above, we were tasked with being able to view and manage departments, roles and employees in the company.
- I learned how to create a schema.sql file that will manage all of the data needed in the application and the proper formatting of the schema.
- I also learned how to format and creat a seeds.sql and execute it through the command line and later on using that data through my index.js.

## Installation & Usage:
- Clone the repository on github locally.
- Install node modules through the command 'npm install' in git bash
- Log into MYSQL2 via commands 'mysql -uroot -p' and enter your password.
- Source and seed the required files and exit once finished.
- Use use 'node index.js' in command line to initialize the application
